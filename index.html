                Hi! I like low-level development, tinkering with systems and developing tooling
                to enhance developer experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of my projects:
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://github.com/flysand7/bake">bake</a> - an imperative build system</h2>
            An imperative build system with caching. Simpler than <code>make</code>, more versatile than
            <code>just</code>. Allows writing a build script using a set of ordered instructions as opposed
            to a set of rules, enhancing the experience of using a build script as opposed to
            writing shell scripts.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/flysand7/x86-disasm">x86-disasm</a> - an x86 disassembler</h2>
            Tiny, parallelizable and embeddable x86 disassembler supporting all general purpose, SSE, SSE2, SSE3,
            SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX and some AVX2 instructions. Includes a fully-functional CLI tool
            including features such as printing in either Intel or adapted AT&T syntax.
            <img src="/images/x86-disasm-screenshot.png" />
            Performs 10x as fast as objdump, or nasm which are the two most known disassemblers to date.
